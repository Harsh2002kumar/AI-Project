            <h3 class="head"> 1. Skin colour</h3>
            <p class="para">This factor is commonly applied to fruits, since skin colour changes as fruit ripens or
                matures. Some fruits exhibit no perceptible colour change during maturation, depending on the type of
                fruit or vegetable. Assessment of harvest maturity by skin colour depends on the judgment of the
                harvester, but colour charts are available for cultivars, such as apples, tomatoes, peaches, chilli
                peppers, etc. <br><br>

            <h3 class="head"> 2. Optical methods</h3>
            <p class="para">Light transmission properties can be used to measure the degree of maturity of fruits. These
                methods are based on the chlorophyll content of the fruit, which is reduced during maturation. The fruit
                is exposed to a bright light, which is then switched off so that the fruit is in total darkness. Next, a
                sensor measures the amount of light emitted from the fruit, which is proportional to its chlorophyll
                content and thus its maturity. <br><br>

            <h3 class="head"> 3. Shape</h3>
            <p class="para">The shape of fruit can change during maturation and can be used as a characteristic to
                determine harvest maturity. For instance, a banana becomes more rounded in cross-sections and less
                angular as it develops on the plant. Mangoes also change shape during maturation. As the mango matures
                on the tree the relationship between the shoulders of the fruit and the point at which the stalk is
                attached may change. The shoulders of immature mangoes slope away from the fruit stalk; however, on more
                mature mangoes the shoulders become level with the point of attachment, and with even more maturity the
                shoulders may be raised above this point. <br><br>

            <h3 class="head"> 4. Size</h3>
            <p class="para">Changes in the size of a crop while growing are frequently used to determine the time of
                harvest. For example, partially mature cobs of Zea mays saccharata are marketed as sweet corn, while
                even less mature and thus smaller cobs are marketed as baby corn. For bananas, the width of individual
                fingers can be used to determine harvest maturity. Usually a finger is placed midway along the bunch and
                its maximum width is measured with callipers; this is referred to as the calliper grade.<br><br>

            <h3 class="head"> 5. Aroma</h3>
            <p class="para">Most fruits synthesize volatile chemicals as they ripen. Such chemicals give fruit its
                characteristic odour and can be used to determine whether it is ripe or not. These doors may only be
                detectable by humans when a fruit is completely ripe, and therefore has limited use in commercial
                situations. <br><br>

            <h3 class="head"> 6. Fruit openings</h3>
            <p class="para">Some fruits may develop toxic compounds during ripening, such as ackee tree fruit, which
                contains toxic levels of hypoglycine. The fruit splits when it is fully mature, revealing black seeds on
                yellow arils. At this stage, it has been shown to contain minimal amounts of hypoglycine or none at all.
                This creates a problem in marketing; because the fruit is so mature, it will have a very short
                post-harvest life. Analysis of hypoglycine 'A'(hyp.) in ackee tree fruit revealed that the seed
                contained appreciable hyp. at all stages of maturity, at approximately 1000 ppm, while levels in the
                membrane mirrored those in the arils. This analysis supports earlier observations that unopened or
                partially opened ackee fruit should not be consumed, whereas fruit that opens naturally to over 15 mm of
                lobe separation poses little health hazard, provided the seed and membrane portions are removed. These
                observations agree with those of Brown et al. (1992) who stated that bright red, full sized ackee should
                never be forced open for human consumption. <br><br>

            <h3 class="head">7. Leaf Changes</h3>
            <p class="para">Leaf quality often determines when fruits and vegetables should be harvested. In root crops,
                the condition of the leaves can likewise indicate the condition of the crop below ground. For example,
                if potatoes are to be stored, then the optimum harvest time is soon after the leaves and stems have
                died. If harvested earlier, the skins will be less resistant to harvesting and handling damage and more
                prone to storage diseases.</p>

            <h3 class="head">8. Abscission</h3>
            <p class="para">As part of the natural development of a fruit an abscission layer is formed in the pedicel.
                For example, in cantaloupe melons, harvesting before the abscission layer is fully developed results in
                inferior flavoured fruit, compared to those left on the vine for the full period.</p>
